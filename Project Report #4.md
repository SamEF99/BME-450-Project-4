# Problem Statement:

For this project, we need to once again visit the OOI website and pull hydrophone broadband data for Oregon Shelf Cabled Benthic Experiment Package and Oregon Offshore Cabled Benthic Experiment Package. Using our results from Project 2, we will identify four time periods: when it is neither rainy nor windy, when it is windy but not rainy, when it is rainy but not windy, and when it is both windy and rainy. We then need to read that data and use it to calculate the power spectral density, then convert the PSD into decibels. For both locations and all four conditions, we need to plot the PSD against frequency, then answer several questions about the effect of wind, rain, and location on underwater sound.

For the second part of the project, we need to read data from the OOI website that contain each of three audio sources: a marine mammal vocalization, an airgun firing, and an earthquake. We need to plot a spectrogram of these sounds, and discuss the bandwidth of the signal and compare it to the Wenz curve to check consistency with what we expect.
